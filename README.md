**PONYTOWN INFORMATION**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, *welcome.*

- Usually on the **18+ server**, not very active but will log in every once in a while.
- Overall talkative and open to new interactions if you aren't rude or mean. 
- Friends, unfriends and hides **liberally.**
- Discord is for those that have grown close enough to need it.

**DNI (DO NOT INTERACT)**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I prefer to keep my space comfortable, so if any of these apply to you, please **don’t interact:**  

- You’re judgmental, passive-aggressive, or just generally mean-spirited.  
- You engage in constant online drama, petty fights, or “callouts” over trivial things.  
  - I won’t get involved, and I don’t want to hear about it.  
- You try to police or dictate how others experience their identity, mental health, or interests.  
- You expect me to tolerate toxicity for the sake of “debate."
- Needless to mention, proshippers, bigots, zionists, endogenic “systems” etc... stay away.
