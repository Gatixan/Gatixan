&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If you don't know who's fronting or don't want to ask, you can call us <b>Two, 206 or Xan.</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>18 years old</b>, we collectively identify as a man, <b>He/It</b> works fine in most instances. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - We're pretty blunt sometimes, don't take that as us not wanting to interact.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - We have pretty **severe memory issues** and sometimes we may not remember you or <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previous conversations, try re-introducing yourself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Happily taken by our [partner system](https://github.com/dirkuu), if you see us around, we're usually with them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Friends, unfriends and hides** happen per our discretion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Discord** is for those that have grown close enough to need it.

**DNI (DO NOT INTERACT)**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I prefer to keep my space comfortable, so if any of these apply to you, please **don’t interact:**  

- **You’re judgmental, passive-aggressive, or mean-spirited AND treat strangers poorly** just because they’re not part of your circle. If you get joy from putting others down, just don’t.  
- **You thrive on online drama, petty fights, or pointless “callouts.”** I don’t care who’s “canceled” this week — I won’t get involved, and I don’t want to hear about it.  
- **You police how others experience their identity, mental health, or interests.** If you think it’s your job to tell people how they should exist, you’re wrong.
  - **This includes people who invalidate, fakeclaim, or dislike systems.** Especially if you don’t have a dissociative disorder but still feel entitled to decide which systems are "real" or "acceptable."   
- **You expect me to tolerate toxicity for the sake of “debate.”** I’m not here to entertain bad-faith arguments or have my boundaries tested like a game.  
- **You are/support proshippers, bigots, Zionists, or endogenic “systems.”** Just leave.
