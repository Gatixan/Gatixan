**SYSTEM INFORMATION**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a small informational blurb. I have **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**, this unfortunately affects the way I interact with people. I may forget you or other things easily. I try  my best to focus and remain grounded. Please be patient.

I’m bodily **18 years old**, and my collective name online is **206 / Twoosix**. 
You may use **he/him, they/them or it/its** on me.


**DNI (DO NOT INTERACT)**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I prefer to keep my space comfortable, so if any of these apply to you, please **don’t interact:**  

- You’re judgmental, passive-aggressive, or just generally mean-spirited.  
- You engage in constant online drama, petty fights, or “callouts” over trivial things.  
  - I won’t get involved, and I don’t want to hear about it.  
- You try to police or dictate how others experience their identity, mental health, or interests.  
- You act entitled to my time, attention, or explanations.  
- You expect me to tolerate toxicity for the sake of “debate."
- Needless to mention, proshippers, bigots, zionists, etc... stay away.
